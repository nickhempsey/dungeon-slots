## Working Title: "Jackpot Dungeon"

--- 

## 1. **Game Overview**

- **Title**: _Jackpot Dungeon_ (placeholder)
    
- **Genre:** Dungeon Crawling Roguelike with Turn-Based, Slot-Driven Combat
    
- **Platform(s):** Mobile (primary target), PC (possible secondary)
    
- **Target Audience:** Fans of roguelikes, turn-based tactics, silly/bright games (e.g., _Grindstone_, _Slay the Spire_, _Inscryption_)
    
- **Game Vision:** A bright, pixel-art dungeon crawl where the chaos of combat is determined by pulling the slots — mixing skill, strategy, and glorious randomness.

## 2. **Gameplay Mechanics**

### Core Loop

- Enter dungeon → Fight monsters with slot-based attacks → Choose paths → Shop/rest/fight → Beat boss → Gain permanent upgrades → Repeat deeper into dungeon.


### Combat System

- **Slot Machine Core:**  
    Each turn, the player spins a limited-slot reel (initially 3 slots, maybe more with upgrades). Each symbol has a different effect:
    - **Attack** (damage enemy)
    - **Heal** (restore HP)
    - **Defense** (shield from next attack)
    - **Channel** (power up next spin, or delay effects)
    - **Wildcards/Special Symbols** (trigger combos)
    
- **Grid-Based vs. Turn-Based Combat:**
    - **Option 1:** _Small 5x5 grid_ DnD-style movement — gives positional strategy (meant to counterbalance the RNG of the slots with player agency).
    - **Option 2:** _Simple Slay the Sprire-style_ 1 vs Many turn system — would be faster but maybe less tactical depth.


### Class System

- **Classes (starter ideas):**
    - **Rogue:** More crits/wildcards, agile.
    - **Warrior:** More defense and heavy attacks. 
	    - Luck Punk
    - **Mage:** Channeling magic, stacking effects.
	    - Slotomancer
    - **Wildcard Class (fun idea):** "The Gambler" — gets _weird_ bonus effects when pulling certain combinations, but at higher risk.

Each class might also influence what symbols appear more frequently on the slot reels.

### Progression & Permanent Upgrades

- After clearing a dungeon set:
    - Gain a **"Slot Mod"** — e.g., permanently add a powerful symbol to your base slot reel.
    - Unlock **"Cheat Codes"** (silly "laws" you break that buff you, in reference to anti-gambling themes).
    - Cosmetic upgrades (hats, silly skins for slot machine reels).

## 3. **Story and Narrative**

- **Tone:** Silly, satirical, light-hearted.
    
- **Possible Premise:**  
    You’re an adventurer trapped inside a "banned" casino-dungeon, where every creature is a warped slot machine or game of chance brought to life. Your goal is to overthrow the _Bureau of Fun Regulation_ (satirical government body that bans anything remotely random) and restore chaos to the world.
    
- **Faction Names (ideas):**
    - **The Bureau of Fun Regulation**
    - **Order of Predictability**
    - **The Funless Few**
    - **Casino Cops**
        
- **Bosses could be:**
    - "The Auditor" (a tax-enforcing boss)
    - "Warden of Probability" (tries to 'normalize' your spins)
    - "The Pit Boss" (casino-themed literal boss)

---

## 4. **World and Level Design**

- **Procedural Dungeon Paths:**  
    Like Slay the Spire: branch options — monsters, shops, mystery events, minibosses, etc.
    
- **Tiles/Rooms Types:**
    - Monster Fight
    - Shop (buy new symbols, upgrade reels)
    - Rest Area (restore HP, small buffs)
    - Elite Monster
    - Mystery Room (random events, could be good or bad)

---

## 5. **Art and Style**

- **Art Direction:**  
    Bright, cartoony pixel art, inspired by _Grindstone_ and _Dicey Dungeons_.
    
- **Design Notes:**
    - Chunky, bold outlines.        
    - Silly monster designs (e.g., literal slot machine monsters with arms and legs).
    
- **UI:**
    - Slot reels visually central.
    - Grid movement is clean, minimal HUD, lofi animations.

---

## 6. **Audio**

- **Music Style:**  
    Lofi, upbeat electronic beats. Chill but mischievous.
    
- **Sound FX:**
    - Satisfying "clink" and "spin" sounds for slot machine actions.
    - Cartoonish "whomp" sounds for attacks.


---

## 7. **Technical Specs**

- **Engine:**  
    Love2D (Lua)
    
- **Performance Target:**  
    Run smoothly on mid-to-low spec mobile devices and PCs.
    
- **Networking:**  
    None initially — fully offline.

---

## 8. **Economy**

- **Currencies:**
    - **Spin Tokens:** Earned during runs, spent in shops to buy or upgrade symbols.
    - **Luck Points:** Permanent meta-currency earned after runs to buy upgrades.


---

## 9. **Monetization**

- None for now. Hobby project.


---

## 10. **Appendices**

- **Inspirations:**
    - _Grindstone_, _Slay the Spire_, _Inscryption_, _Luck Be A Landlord_, _Dicey Dungeons_, _Balatro_.
        
- **Notes/Other Ideas:**
    - Event rooms where you can **"bribe"** casino gods for buffs.
    - Symbols could **mutate** (e.g., Attack symbols sometimes turn into Wilds or Debuffs mid-run).
    - Add "House Rules" modifiers that alter how spins work per dungeon level.

## More to brainstorm

- **Title ideas:** (Jackpot Dungeon, Reel Chaos, Dungeon of Odds?)
- **Permanent upgrades theme:** (Slot Modifiers, Casino Codes, Cheater’s Tricks?)
- **Final decision on grid combat vs simple turn-based** (leaning grid based)
- **Factions/Enemies:** funny names/designs for bosses/monsters.
- **Overall visual style references:** (can gather a little mood board maybe)
