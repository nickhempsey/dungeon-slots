## Task List

- [ ] **1. Data Modeling** 

	- [ ] **1.1 Define core entities and relationships**  
	     - [x] Player
	     - [x] Enemy
	     - [x] Ability
	     - [x] Symbol

	     - [x] Currency
	     - [x] XP
	     - [x] LootDrop  
	     - [x] InitiativeState
	     - [x] PhaseState
	     - [x] Bank (symbol inventory)  
     
	- [ ] **1.2 Specify attributes**  
     • Ability requirements (symbol costs), effects (damage, heal, stun, etc.), chances (crit, proc, etc.)  
     • Symbol tiers/levels for upgrades  
     • Enemy AI profile tags (aggressive, tank, healer, …)  

- [ ] **2. Turn & Phase Management**  

	- [x] **2.1 Implement Turn Controller**  
     • Track active actor (player or enemy)  
     • Sequence through phases: Resolve Status → Roll → Main → Upgrade → End  

	- [ ] **2.2 Status‐Effect System**  
     • Queue and resolve negative effects first, then positive  
     • Support stacking, durations, triggers on apply/remove  

- [ ] **3. Rolling & Symbol Banking**  

	- [ ] **3.1 Coin‐roll mechanic**  
	     • Limit rolls by available “coin” resource  
	     • Random symbol generation, weighted by reel configuration  
     
    - [ ]  **3.2 Bank management**  
	     • Add rolled symbols to bank  
	     • Persist bank across main phase, clear at turn end or as rules dictate  

- [ ] **4. Abilities & Symbol Expenditure**
	- [ ]  **4.1 Ability requirement checks**  
	     • Ensure bank has required symbols before activation 
     
     - [ ] **4.2 Execution engine**  
	     • Apply damage/heal/status based on ability definition  
	     • Roll internal chances (hit, crit, proc, chain, bleed, burn, etc.)  
     
	   - [ ] **4.3 Targeting & multi‐target support**  
     • Single vs. multi‐enemy targeting  
     • Friendly targeting for heals/defense  

- [ ] **5. Loot, XP & Currency**  

	- [ ] **5.1 Enemy death resolution**  
	     • Roll for drop types: heal charges, symbols, abilities  
	     • Grant XP and defined currencies  
	- [ ] **5.2 Persistence**  
     • Accumulate player XP/currencies across battles  

- [ ] **6. Upgrade Phase**  

	- [ ] **6.1 Currency spending UI & logic**  
	     • Purchase additional reels  
	     • Upgrade symbol tiers on existing reels (e.g. Sword 1→2, Heart 2→3)  
     
	- [ ] **6.2 Update reel configurations and reroll probabilities**  

- [ ] **7. Enemy AI Behaviors**  

	- [ ] **7.1 Base AI framework**  
	     • Decision loop: choose ability based on profile + available symbols  
     
	- [ ] **7.2 Implement profiles**  
	     • Aggressive: bias toward offensive abilities  
	     • Tank: bias toward defense/heal/self-preservation  
	     • Healer: support wounded allies first  
	     • Placeholder for future profiles (ranged, debuffer, etc.)  
     
	- [ ] **7.3 (Optional) Enemy upgrades**  
	     • Decide if/when enemies get currency and upgrade capabilities  
	     • Tweak as difficulty knob  

- [ ] **8. UI & UX**  

   - [ ] **8.1 Combat HUD**  
     • Phase indicator, status‐effect icons, bank display, currency/XP counters  
     
   - [ ] **8.2 Roll interface**  
     • Reel visuals, roll animation, symbol highlights  
     
   - [ ] **8.3 Ability panel**  
     • Show unlocked abilities, symbol costs, cooldowns or per-round limits
