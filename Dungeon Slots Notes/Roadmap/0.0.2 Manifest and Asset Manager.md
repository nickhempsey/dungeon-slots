- [x]  Scaffold Manifest Manager framework
- [x]  Enable Import Related Tables 
      `Abilities, Effects, Symbols, etc`
- [x]  Build Dynamic properties
    `baseStats` can be a randomized set of values that get resolved at run time 
    `baseStats.health = math.random(5, 15)` returns `stats.health = 12` 
- [x]  Create OnDemand properties for stats that are done during an action phase of something. 
      `rollCrit = math.random() < 0.2` 20% chance to critical hit
      At call time `entity.roll('crit')` return `true | false`
- [x]   Integrate Sprite and Animation Loading
- [x]   Convert Aseprite JSON export into an animation system
      Export sprites as `entity_id.png` and `entity_id.json`
      On request, load this data from json into a Lua table using the Peachy library
- [ ]  Extend Peachy to do looping
	    Will probably circle back after I've used it for a bit and make more adjustments
- [x]  Implement Grid Debugger `f3` + `g`
