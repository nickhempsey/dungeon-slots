A lore focused room that presents the player with a choice to make.  

In Inscryption for example, the player can try and sit a card by the fire with these creepy guys.  If the player succeeds they get an upgrade to that card, if they fail it can reduce the power of that card. 

In Slay the Spire, there are a variety of mechanics.

Below is a bunch of kickstarter ideas provided by ChatGPT. There might be a gem or two in here. One take away, I do like the idea that specific characters might have special mystery rooms of their own.
